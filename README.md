Description - Downloads images from reddit urls stored in urls.txt then displays them as a slide show using feh. Also checks file size in image header to avoid displaying 'This image is no longer available image' on imgur. I have this setup running on an rpi3 with the taskbar disabled and set to autorun when raspbian boots. Runs pretty flawlessly and have spent many hours working on this.
